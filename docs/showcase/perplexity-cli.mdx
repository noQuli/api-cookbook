# Project Title

The Perplexity CLI provides AI-powered research and reasoning capabilities directly in your terminal. It leverages Perplexity's Sonar models to deliver real-time, citation-backed responses optimized for developer workflows, allowing you to use a lot of integrated functions and tools.

## Features

- Multiple Sonar models including pro, reasoning-pro, and deep-research variants
- Built-in tools: File operations, shell commands, web fetching.
- Extensible: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations.
- Terminal-first: Designed for developers who live in the command line.


## Prerequisites

1. Node.js version 20 or higher 
2. macOS, Linux or Windows
3. A Perplexity API key (get one at https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

## Installation

npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

## Usage

perplexity - opens interactive CLI with straightforward usage 


## Code Explanation

Written mostly in TS, JS is used for building, ESM, linting and some others thing.
Node.js, docker, vitest for testing. 
Ink and React for interactive cli - there is a lot of mocking tests,
and so as integrating tests which i deleted from workflows cause perplexity. 

1.  **CLI package (`packages/cli`):**
    - **Purpose:** This contains the user-facing portion of Perplexity CLI, such as handling the initial user input, presenting the final output, and managing the overall user experience.
    - **Key functions contained in the package:**
      - [Input processing](./cli/commands.md)
      - History management
      - Display rendering
      - [Theme and UI customization](./cli/themes.md)
      - [CLI configuration settings](./cli/configuration.md)

2.  **Core package (`packages/core`):**
    - **Purpose:** This acts as the backend for Perplexity CLI. It receives requests sent from `packages/cli`, orchestrates interactions with the configured model API, and manages the execution of available tools.
    - **Key functions contained in the package:**
      - API client for communicating with the Perplexity AI API
      - Prompt construction and management
      - Tool registration and execution logic
      - State management for conversations or sessions
      - Server-side configuration

3.  **Tools (`packages/core/src/tools/`):**
    - **Purpose:** These are individual modules that extend the capabilities of the Perplexity model, allowing it to interact with the local environment (e.g., file system, shell commands, web fetching).
    - **Interaction:** `packages/core` invokes these tools based on requests from the Perplexity model.

## Limitations

-Token caching effectiveness depends on context similarity between queries

-MCP server tools require separate installation and configuration

-API rate limits apply based on your Perplexity subscription tier
